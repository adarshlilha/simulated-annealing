A bubble plot chart showing movies liked by critics but not by audience, from 2007 to 2017. 


Uses [d3js](https://d3js.org/) for chart generation and [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) for removal of label overlaps


With reference from annealing implementation of [d3-labeler](https://github.com/tinker10/D3-Labeler)
